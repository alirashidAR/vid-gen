## Local Setup

To set up the **Video Creative Generation and Scoring API** locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:

1. **Python 3.7+**  
   Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the necessary Python libraries by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up AWS S3**  
   The video generation output is stored in AWS S3, so ensure that you have an AWS account with access to S3. Create an S3 bucket and update the environment variables with the necessary credentials:

   - **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**
   - **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**
   - **AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME**

4. **Set Up Gemini, Pexels, and Edge TTS APIs**  
   You'll need valid API keys for:
   - **Gemini API** for script generation and visual asset evaluation.
   - **Pexels API** for fetching stock images.
   - **Edge TTS** for converting text to speech.
   
   Store these API keys in environment variables.

### Running the API Server:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alirashidAR/onlinesales-hack
   cd onlinesales-hack
   ```

2. Set up the environment variables for your API keys and AWS credentials:

   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
   export PEXELS_API_KEY="your-pexels-api-key"
   export EDGE_TTS_API_KEY="your-edge-tts-api-key"
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-access-key"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-aws-secret-key"
   export AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME="your-s3-bucket-name"
   ```

3. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

   This will start the server locally on port 8000.

### Testing the API:

Once the server is running, you can test the endpoints using a tool like **Postman** or **curl**.

- To generate a video, make a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/generate_video` with the JSON body as described above.
- To grade a video, make a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/grade_video` with the necessary parameters.
